# Plant Disease Detection 

## Overview

Welcome to PhytoSense- Plant Disease Detection Model! This deep learning model is designed to analyze plant leaf images and identify potential diseases that the plant might be suffering from. The model is deployed on a website, allowing users to easily upload images and receive information about the detected diseases.

## Features

- *Image Upload:* Users can upload images of plant leaves through our website.
- *Disease Prediction:* The model analyzes the uploaded image and predicts the potential diseases affecting the plant.
- *Output Presentation:* The results are presented in a user-friendly manner, providing information about the detected disease and confidence percentage.

## How to Use

1. *Access the Website:*
   - Navigate to link- https://phytosenseversion1-com.onrender.com/  to access the Plant Disease Detection application.

2. *Upload an Image:*
   - Click on the "Upload" button to select an image of a plant leaf from your device.

3. *View Results:*
   - Once the image is uploaded, the model will process it and display the results on our website.
   - The results will include the name of the detected disease with the confidence percentage along with additional information and recommendations.

4. *Interpret Results:*
   - Users can interpret the results and take appropriate actions based on the identified disease.

## System Requirements

- Compatible web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection

## Model Details

- *Model Architecture:*  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- *Training Data:* The model was trained on a diverse dataset of plant leaf images with associated disease labels.
- *Accuracy:* The accuracy of our model is more than 95.5%.
## Dependencies

The Plant Disease Detection Model relies on the following libraries and frameworks:

- TensorFlow
- Gradio
- Pillow (PIL)
- React (for the website frontend).
- NodeJs, Express, MongoDB(for the website backend).
